    and so her hair looks a bit flat and her eyes are quite spaced out. as of writing this, 
    this is a slightly older design of vii, featuring discolorations on her ears and cow lick, 
    and a little gadget on her left ear"

    In particular, I really like how the hands turned out. I've usually just avoided drawing them altogether. 
    The lineart feels a bit all over the place? I played with a *bunch* of effects for this one: 
    I applied half toning to all the colors, I added some grain-ness for style. 
    A millions little things for the glasses, which I'm happy with the idea of but I wish it could have made more poppy. 
    There wasn't much I could do without distracting from an otherwise dark image"

    the usual effects. usually I fill in the darker areas of the character with lineart,
    but this time I decided to make it a lot... \"scratchier\". I like it. 
    The coloring is messy in I think a cute way. 
    I also changed my art style somewhat since the last image, using much rounder faces 
    instead of ovals. the eyes are much larger and rounder, and hopefully a bit more cutely chaotic :3. "
