so artfight was fun. can't wait for next year!!

I posted all my attacks on the [drawings page](/art/) and my [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/parchii). 
and of course you can look at the [actual art fight page](https://artfight.net/~parchii/attacks) lol

As for my game, I'm rapidly losing motivation to work on levels, again. 
I'm not going to be able to finish the game before school starts. I'll continue trying to finish it.

have a nice day :3
