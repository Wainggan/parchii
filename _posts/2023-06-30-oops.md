whoopsy daisy forgot about the site again lmao (except this time it wasn't entirely my fault)

I was gonna write a post about writing a lisp parser but I ended up losing the files? so oh well. I was also going to upload some of my art to here but I ended up losing most of it too, so that's fun! I'll get it back soon-ish hopefully (maybe (possibly)), so. idk. fingers crossed!!

additionally. I use [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/parchii) sometimes now! (this has nothing to do with reddit)

finally. I'm working on my game again! took a while to get the inspiration back, but I'm getting back to it. I will need to rework a lot of mechanics now, so. yippee? I'll also need to rewrite music now that I've gotten somewhat better, so! yep.

lastly. I'm gonna attempt to join [art fight](https://artfight.net/), so that could be funny maybe. will update on how that goes.

thanks for reading stranger, have a nice day :3
