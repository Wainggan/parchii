idk, who knows what I did today

## bullet hell

put more work into the bullet hell, as per the usual. this time I decided to try overhauling Red's theme while I still can. 

I don't have much to comment on here. I'm having a difficult time getting the mix to sound soft, like it originally was. it probably has something to do with my recent obsession with harder, grittier synth sounds, which by habit, I used in this new theme. 

It shall be named *Ardent Shot*, because I'm saving the name Ardency for something else. 


## music

I'm going to try mustering up the courage to upload some music to [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/parchiimint) (url subject to change...)


## media

played splatoon (woo)


## misc

sometimes it feels like we watch the world burn under a guise of excitement
