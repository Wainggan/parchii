tldr: released my first ep!

## music

as the tldr subtly implied, I released some music for the first time!

the album is called "Cutting It Thin". it's 4 electric industrial-ish dubstep (pre-2010s style, absolutely not brostep) tracks, that I composed, mixed, and (ungracefully) mastered. 

the songs have elements of obviously amateur habits, but I wanted to release them anyways (instead of waiting to gain more experience) because I thought it'd be satisfying. it was a lot of fun putting it together.

the music was created and mixed with FLStudio 21, plus several free plugins. the cover was made in Krita.
