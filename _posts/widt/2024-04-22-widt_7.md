not much

## art

I found my tablet pen thing, which I lost all the way back in [widt 1]({% post_url /2024-04-05-widt_1 %})! I used it to draw this:

{% include picture.html src="/asset/art/gen/2024-04/ave" %}

was really happy about finding it. the image itself is okay... could be better in a lot of places but whatever.


## ardent shot

put some time into the story and dialogue for the game. the game should be ready for testing in less than a month. 


## music

on the side, I'm still working on songs for like 3 projects. going to be a good while until anything is finished.

I'm probably going to burn out *hard*. not excited for that.
