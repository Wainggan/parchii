the usual.

## gamaing

worked on [ardent shot a little bit more]({% post_url ardency/ardentshot/2024-04-17-log_1 %}). fixed bugs and drew a new sprite for Red.

### rase

finally worked on Rodney and Snake. I focused my efforts on Rodney's controller, because it desperately needed a cleanup if it was to be extended even a bit further than it had. all I really did was hook together the state machine I threw together, read added jumping and dashing, and then tuned them. I also copied some nullstars scripts into the game, for later use. particularly, the input system! the game now has rudimentary controller support.

## website

I went and created dedicated pages for [nullstars](/nullstars/) and [ardent shot](/ardency/ardentshot/), even giving nullstars a different css style. I'll do the same for ardency when I feel like it.

I also moved all the old posts from before the [big site rework]({% post_url 2024-02-14-secondfirstpost %}). I went ahead and updated outdated urls, metadata, and images.
