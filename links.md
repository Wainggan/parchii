links!! i gather these like cards

- [beepbox](https://photomosh.com/) is a very nice open source retro music online daw

	- I recommend using a mod of it, [jummbox](https://jummbus.bitbucket.io/). it adds a lot of features, but in particular, its "mod" channel feature (which function like automation clips in flstudio, for example) is very powerful. I use it for drafting music before putting it in flstudio

- [audiotool](https://www.audiotool.com/app/#/) is another online daw. technically more powerful, but its exceptionally tedious to use. I used it for Ejow's soundtrack

- [nicky case](https://ncase.me/) has a ton of good stuff

- [jamis buck's blog](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/27/maze-generation-growing-tree-algorithm#) is full of great stuff. this link is to their post explaining the "growing tree" maze generation algorithm, and they have a lot of posts about maze generation algorithms

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), an open source javascript library that makes it trivial to use various javascript functions, like drawing to the canvas. it also has an online editor! 

	- a lot of my projects in my [projects page](/portfolio/projects) use p5.js, sometimes mostly for the online editor after I gut the library lol

	- [q5.js](https://github.com/LingDong-/q5xjs) is another library that tries to be p5.js but much faster and smaller. it's mostly accurate but there are several notable discrepancies between the p5.js and q5.js's behaviour.

	- [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), arguably the most famous. 128x128 display, 16 preset colors(*technically* more, but we don't talk about that), basic sound, and a lua code limit. very fun, probably! I've never used it lmao
