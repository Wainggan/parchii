title: ardent shot's graphics, explained (part 1)
---

this game has a lot more going drawn on screen than it seems!

these following few posts will be about ardent shot's graphics pipeline. what is in it, what it does to look at least a little bit not like shit while keeping gameplay someone sane to look at. the entire process is quite simple, and can be replicated in pretty much anything that runs opengl.

disclaimer: while I am working on [nullstars](/nullstars/) as well, nothing here really apply to nullstars' rendering pipeline. I'll talk about that seperately, when the time comes. 

## step one

before we even get to the rendering, setup needs to happen.
