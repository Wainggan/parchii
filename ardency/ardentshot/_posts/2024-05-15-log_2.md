tldr: stage 2 complete


## levels

stage 2 has been fully mapped out and finished. this includes the stage portion and red's boss. 

next in the todo list for stage 2:

- a single enemy sprite
- a single map region because im a dumbass
- balancing
- maybe a new red theme
- oh shit right his tail needs to be added

the game has some crashes still, the two off the top of my head happen in the menus, and rarely when you die. I'll need to iron those out. more sound effects are needed too. 

otherwise? the game is feeling good for a demo soonish. I keep saying that...


## graphics

new sprite for red when he moves!


## meta

I made a [discord server](https://discord.gg/G6a2RjA5G2) for testing.
