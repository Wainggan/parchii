# misc

these don't have the same scope as my [main projects](.), but are still possibly interesting in their own right.


- my [scratch account](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Wainggan/) has several little toys and such.
- I also [mess around with shaders](https://www.shadertoy.com/profile/wainggan) from time to time

- some of my [socials](/social) have projects in them, most notably my youtube channel. 

- [worely toy](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/tL54E-z-z), a badly written tool for generating worely noise images. could use a rewrite.
- a [simple 2d ball simulation thing](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/0kUuPKS3x). it had an unfortunate bug of some balls getting randomly stuck
- a [simple 2d physics thing](https://github.com/Wainggan/ballbounce). used to generate [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqT3xtvrFjQ)
- [little quad tree](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/Co8RTWeUa) implementation
- [Floyd-Steinberg dithering](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/4TBDOyOMg)
- [palette quantizer](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/6UfLl91Yv)
- [msaa antialiasing](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/QMQFzsIzF)
- ["Terraria" pixel smoother](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/AGu2ugdwn). once I found an image that claimed that Terraria smoothens its pixels when zoomed in, and I tried to recreate it. I'm pretty sure this doesn't actually happen in Terraria.
- [metaballs](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/nwKbeeCXm)
- [verlet ropes](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/7KLSUQ8bq)
- an attempt to [render bullet hell bullets as metaballs](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/Co78ejWvR). was too slow to be practical.
- [bezier curves](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/d7Wr_cMCl)
- [platformer + verlet ropes](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/aH1yhMO5K). tried experimenting to see if verlet ropes could be used for hair and tail simulations in platformers. the answer is yes, but it is quite slow. 
- [wtext](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/0032V6n03), an implementation of a simple text markup system I made, based on bbcode. I ported this to GameMaker to be used in a game.
- [old Myano](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/e-jkUeuaj), a prehistoric implementation of myano, back when it was still dynamically typed (and had an uppercased name). there's an even older version somewhere too, I don't know where it is. I made the mistake of implementing it in javascript.
- [Myano Typed attempt](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/cCkLysA1s), an attempt at giving Myano types. abandoned.
- [second order dynamics](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/R8yDGNkZ9), which I use all the time for animations.
- [GameMaker blendmode emulation](https://editor.p5js.org/Wainggan/sketches/Rn4XYFD5O). possibly inaccurate.
- word generator (@todo: link)
